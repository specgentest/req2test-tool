Prompt:
        
Create the class CustomerGeneratedAttributeTest with JUnit5 to validate:
Do not include generated attributes (e.g., id) in constructors.
- licenseNumberExpirationDate as Date and with the following validation: must be equals current date + 5 years

Use the following data as constructor parameters.
Customer = {fullName=ValidString, licenseNumber=1234-56, birthDate=current date - 20 years}
The test must create a Customer and validate if licenseNumberExpirationDate was generated correctly.
Consider the existing classes (Do not implement them):

Customer
- fullName: String
- licenseNumber: String
- licenseNumberExpirationDate: Date
- birthDate: Date

The constructor of each class must accept all the attributes listed above as parameters.

Consider type Date as LocalDate. Consider type Time as LocalTime.

Ensure all model classes are imported from req2test.tool.outputArtefacts/project1.model.

Ensure all exception classes are imported from req2test.tool.outputArtefacts/project1.exception.

Add all necessary imports (e.g. Asserts and verify from JUnit5, LocalDate).
Structure each test case using the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern: 
                        first set up the necessary objects and data (Arrange), 
                        then execute the operation being tested (Act), 
                        and finally verify the result (Assert).
                        
Create only the CustomerGeneratedAttributeTest class as output from this prompt. 

The classes [Customer] already exist. Do not create them.
